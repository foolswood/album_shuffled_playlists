# album_shuffled_playlists

VW, Audi and Skoda cars can play music from an SD card or USB drive.

Unfortunately it seems that the car will only shuffle at the track level.

So if you want to listen to albums in order then the order is always the same
and if you have more than one album by an artist they'll play one after the
other.

However playlist files are supported, so this tool generates a some of those in
album shuffled order.

Non-techie instructions
=======================

You'll need python installed (see https://www.python.org/ for download and instructions).

Copy `generate_album_shuffled_playlists.py` to the music directory on the SD card.

Run it and it'll make some playlists.
